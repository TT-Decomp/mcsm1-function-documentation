# ðŸ§  MCSM1 Function Documentation

This repository contains detailed notes and labels for function offsets found within **Minecraft: Story Mode â€“ Season 1 Complete Edition**.  
It is part of the broader effort under the [TT-Decomp](https://github.com/TT-Decomp) organization to reverse-engineer and document the Telltale Tool engine.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

The goal of this repo is to maintain a centralized, human-readable reference of:

- Function **offsets** in the game binary
- **User-assigned names** based on behavior
- **Guessed purpose** or role in the engine/system

All labels are inferred through reverse engineering (e.g., IDA, Ghidra) and may evolve as analysis progresses.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Function entries are stored in this format:

| Offset     | Name             | Description / Guess                                     |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x1ECAC0` | `TT_LogShutdown` | Called during system shutdown; logs source file strings |
| `0x14F8A0` | `SceneManager::Init` | Likely related to scene system initialization         |
| ...        | ...              | ...                                                      |

You can find the full list in [`FUNCTIONS.md`](FUNCTIONS.md).

## ðŸ“Ž Conventions

- Offsets are in **hex**, relative to the main executable base.
- Names are **user-defined** and follow C++-style conventions when applicable.
- Descriptions are based on behavior, naming clues, and reverse engineering context.
- If the purpose is unclear, use `???` and update when more is known.
